# check_rcptto_exists Version 1.0 by Marc Sebastian Pelzer
#
# This plugin check wether a recipient of an incoming email exists in our local virtual-domains alias
# configuration file(s).
# The path to the alias file is hard-coded into this plug-in and you may need to modify it a bit in
# order to fit your set-up. Should not be a big problem if you know Perl :)
#
# You should create a config-file called "config/relayclients" which should contain a (maybe dynamically created)
# list of IP's or hostnames which are white-listed from this plug-in. It is recommended to put your relay-client's
# IP's inside this file, otherwise all outgoing connections will be rejected because the recipient of the outgoing
# mail is not locally known. 
#
# Fell free to change that behaviour as you like and to use this plug-in as an example for your own alias check.
